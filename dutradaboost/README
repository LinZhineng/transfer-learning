This is the code for ‘Adaptive Boosting for Transfer Learning using Dynamic Updates’ by Samir Al-Stouhi and Chandan K. Reddy. Usually this code performs a little bit better than tradaboost.


DuTrAdaBoostTrain.m is for training
DuTrPredict.m is for prediction.

Please compile the toolbox and addpath to toolbox before using.
addpath('./toolbox/libsvm-weights-3.20/matlab');
